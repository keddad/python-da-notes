Kwame is a teacher within the Boston Public School District and has been teaching for six years. He currently teaches 7th & 8th Grade Math.

A little bit about myself and my home:

I am an entrepreneur in my late 20s working on a marketing company. I grow up in Brookline, MA and lived in Boston for most of my life. People who meet me usually take note of my love of helping people.  All my family and friends know I am the ""go to"" if they are in a jam, need advice or if the just need to hang out and have a good time. 

I started hosting on Air B&B December 2012 at my previous home.  I recently moved into a new house in August 2013.  I loved my first experience hosting throw Air B&B so much i decided to continue hosting in my new home.  In my new house I have taken hosting to a new level.  Firstly I used my extensive knowledge of Boston to find a home in the most perfect location for all travelers.  Once I found the perfect location I then focused my attention to providing a splendid stay.  I panted every room, brought beautiful furniture, plants, paintings and so much more.  My mission is to provide all of my wonderful guests with a hotel experience while still staying true to the bargain and homey feel of a B&B.  I always strive for perfection and I constantly look for ways of improving my home for my guests.  

I am a true Boston native lived here my hole life.  I know everything Boston so if you have any questions ask away!  I am a big sports fan on Sundays you will find me watching football and everyone is always welcome to join.  I love all kinds of food, which may stem from huge diverse family.  I love working out, running, biking, swimming, yoga and playing sports.  Boston is a very young city and because of that I need to keep myself fit and young in order to keep up with the city.  I love to travel I have been all over the world.  I enjoy camping, grilling, hiking... anything and everything outside.

What helps me the most with hosting is my love for people.   Having the ability to provide my guests with a amazing stay in Boston is my #1 goal.
