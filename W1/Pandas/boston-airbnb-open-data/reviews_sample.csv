Islam managed pretty well our arrival, even if it was last minute ;) i do recommand this place to any airbnb user :)"

2,1178162,5003196,2013-06-06,6449554,Sebastian,We really enjoyed our stay at Islams house. From the outside the house didn't look so inviting but the inside was very nice! Even though Islam himself was not there everything was prepared for our arrival. The airport T Station is only a 5-10 min walk away. The only little issue was that all the people in the house had to share one bathroom. But it was not really a problem and it worked out fine. We would recommend Islams place for a stay in Boston.

The location is superb: A Latin-American neighborhood close to the airport and just a few subway rides away from downtown. Highly recommened!

We had a really nice time in Boston and they had a big part on that.
If you want to go out doing sth - just ask them and they may come with you.
Really nice and clean house - near to the airport and the subway station ( like 6 minutes away ). 

We had a really good time there and can just recommend it to anyone who want to have a comfortable and enjoyable place to stay in Boston for a good price. Thanks a lot.

8,1178162,7646702,2013-09-28,8197342,Arkadiusz,"The place is really well furnished, pleasant and clean. Islam was very helpful, you can feel free to ask him virtually anything and he'll help you. He was fun too, very cool talking to him. Oh, and the place is pretty conveniently located too. Highly recommended.

The neighbourhood might not be the cleanest in Boston (my gf liked Brooklyne much more in that matter), but this is a great location and price for value overall."

Islam was always quick to respond to any questions or concerns we had and very accommodating at every point in our trip! Truly a wonderful place and a lovely host!"
